### flex source cleaner

This is an old project that has become useful again, however it only supports flex 3 right now.
Also I've more recently been using a gem: [flex-source-inspector](https://github.com/edeustace/flex-source-inspector) for this
as it can be used programmatically.

### original
The original code was based on it depends: http://code.google.com/p/it-depends/wiki/UsingItDepends from Joe Berkowitz.
